# steamcmd-snap

A proof of concept repo for packaging up steamcmd as a Snap. Packaging steamcmd as a functional Snap that you can install and use locally is blocked by [this](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/trouble-snapping-disk-space-aware-applications/16796) issue.

TODO: Ideally, the Snapcraft process would pull the steamcmd tar file from Valve and extract it during the build process.
